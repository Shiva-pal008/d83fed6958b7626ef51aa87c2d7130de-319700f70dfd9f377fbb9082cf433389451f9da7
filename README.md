#Tic Tac Toe

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python. The game allows two players to play against each other, taking turns to place their markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their markers vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without any player achieving a three-in-a-row, the game is declared a draw.
